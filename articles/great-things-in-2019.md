The best of 2019 that I discovered, loved and kept close to me. This blog post is inspired by [fogus: The Best Things and Stuff of 2019](http://blog.fogus.me/2019/12/30/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2019/). Everything is in no particular order.

## Favorite podcasts listened to

2019 was the year I started listening to podcasts actively. I regret not having done that much earlier, when I first found out about them.
Well in my defense, I only subscribed to Spotify Premium this year (even thought it's not the only way to listen to these!)

* [Startup](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/startup) - *I loved the episodes about Gimlet, the company that created this podcast. It is a genuine great and emotional adventure about the journey of creating a startup and I enjoyed every second of it. I binged all episodes about Gimlet in less than a month.*
* [Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all) - *I found out about this podcast from Waveform (the one below) and the stories told are seriously great.*
* [Waveform](https://open.spotify.com/show/6o81QuW22s5m2nfcXWjucc) - *In-depth discussions about the latest tech from MKBHD, the largest technology channel on YouTube. Having high expectations when this was announced, I was not disappointed when I actually listened to it.*

## Favorite musicians discovered

All artists here are in the Lo-Fi genre. It is my favorite music genre and listen to it almost exclusively, both at home and on my almost daily public transport rides
to work/school.

* [City Girl](https://twitter.com/citygirltime) - *I love that almost every song has a story behind it which completes the City Girl character.*
* [Dontcry](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3vzJueN7TkCtYpz1myVmDU)

## Great tools discovered

Everything from apps, platforms, extensions etc. that I discovered in 2019 and use (almost) daily.

* [Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com) - *Unlimited skipping, no-ads and offline listening. Don't know how I survived 2018 with just Spotify free. Streaming is just too convient.*
* [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) - *Automatically skips sponsor spots in YouTube videos, don't know how I was able to watch YouTube without this.*
* [Tildes](https://tildes.net/) - *News aggregator like HN but with higher quality comments and posts. If you want an invite, just send me a tweet via Twitter, I got a few invite codes.*
* [Neon](https://www.neon-free.ch/en/) - *Banking startup in Switzerland. Great product and easy to use app, will probably switch to it fully in the future once it IPO'd (or got acquired).*
* [GSMArena](https://www.gsmarena.com/) - *News and information about everything smartphone related - as I'm a tech enthusiast I check it out on the daily.*

## Programming languages I hacked in

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Go](https://golang.org/)
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)

## Tech products I bought

In order of bought starting from the beginning of 2019 until the end.

* [Samsung Galaxy Watch](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-watch/) - *Having a smart watch is just too convient and I see why these days so many people in my age have one.*
* [Sony WH-1000XM3](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3/buy/wh1000xm3-b) - *Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) headphones really made a huge difference. Suddenly I was actually looking forward to the almost daily public transport rides.*
* [Logitech G Pro](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ch/products/gaming-mice/pro-hero.html) - *My old mouse stopped working after four years of use so this'll hopefully be a worthy successor.*
* [Huawei Matebook 13](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/laptops/matebook-13/) - *Got it at a discount and honestly a great, fast and portable laptop.*
* [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/) - *Wanted one since the beginning of 2019 and was able to get it off on Black Friday. Really cool console which I love for its portability. Finally I can really game on the go.*

## Plans for 2020

* Write a blog post at least once two months.
* Start building a portofolio on GitHub.
* Contribute more to open-source projects.
* Shrink my [Plan to Watch](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/mari3842h?status=6) list.
* Pass my upcoming Cambridge CAE exam in March.
* Pass the four month personal project we have in school in August.
* Stop some coping mechanisms.

So let's start this year with high spirit. See you maybe for the "Great things in 2020" blog post.
